# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project builds a **diabetes prediction model** using medical diagnostic measurements such as glucose level, BMI, age, insulin, etc.  
It applies machine learning techniques to classify whether a patient is likely to have diabetes.

## Contents
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing and skewed data
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
- Train-test split
- Model training (Logistic Regression / KNN / SVM / Random Forest)
- Model evaluation: accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC–AUC

## Key Concepts
- Medical dataset preprocessing
- Importance of scaling in health data
- Performance comparison of multiple models
- Evaluating clinical prediction systems

## Libraries Used
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
